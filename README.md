# Toy version of Angular 2: understand the magic!
 
Angular 2 has lots of interesting techniques and concepts, but it's quite hard to figure how it really does its magic.

 
I've started to write a [simple educational version of Angular 2](gist-of-angular-2.js), in plain ES6. It's under 350 LOC including lots of comments. This working toy ([see the demo](https://timruffles.github.io/gist-of-angular-2/)) does many things the same way as the real Angular 2 - for instance, it compiles components into fast, monomorphic functions by compiling their templates.

 
The goal is to implement the hairy 'magic' bits of Angular 2 in code that's as short and readableas possible.

 
üëç If you enjoy [reading it](gist-of-angular-2.js), please let me know by starring the repo, or via [@timruffles](https://twitter.com/timruffles). There's a lot more to write, and I'd love to do just that if sufficient numbers of people would find that interesting.


I made [something similar](https://github.com/timruffles/cute) for Angular 1.
