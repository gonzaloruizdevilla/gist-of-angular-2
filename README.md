Angular 2 has lots of interesting techniques and concepts, but it's quite hard to figure out what's going on under the hood.

 
I've started to write a simple educational version of Angular 2, in plain ES6. This working toy does many things the same way as the real Angular 2 - for instance, it compiles components into fast, monomorphic functions by compiling their templates.

 
The goal is to implement the hairy 'magic' bits of Angular 2 in code that's as short and readableas possible.
